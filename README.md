# Guess the Phrase

![Guess the Phrase Game](images/gameplay.gif)

## Background

I learned how to use vanilla JS to create a simple and fun game with quirky animations and clean graphics.

## How to Play

Use the available on-screen QWERTY keyboard to select a letter from the phrase above you. If the letter is correct, it'll display in the grey block, if it is incorrect, you'll lose 1 of your 5 hearts below. Don't lose all 5, or you'll lose the game and have to start over! Have fun, and get _funky_ with it!
